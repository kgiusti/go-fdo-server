## Overview

**Platform Note**: This guide uses file paths and commands for Fedora, RHEL, and CentOS. If you are using a different operating system or distribution, adjust the certificate and configuration file paths accordingly.

The `go-fdo-server` requires three different X.509 public key certificates and their associated private keys for FDO protocol operation.

1. **Manufacturer Certificate**
   - Certificate (`manufacturer.crt`): Local to Manufacturing server only
   - Private key (`manufacturer.key`): Local to Manufacturing server only

2. **Owner Certificate**
   - Certificate (`owner.crt`): Generated on Owner server, then copied to Manufacturing server
   - Private key (`owner.key`): Local to Owner server only

3. **Device CA Certificate**
   - Shared: Required for Manufacturing server, optional for Owner and Rendezvous servers
   - Certificate (`device-ca.crt`): Required on Manufacturer, optionally provided to Owner and Rendezvous servers for trust verification
   - Private Key (`device-ca.key`): Local to Manufacturing server only

## Certificate Types

### Local Certificates

**Manufacturer Certificate** (`/etc/pki/go-fdo-server/{manufacturer.crt,manufacturer.key}`)
- Used only by the Manufacturing server
- Signs vouchers during device initialization (DI protocol)
- Must be created manually or using the helper script
- Default filenames in configs: `manufacturer-example.crt`/`manufacturer-example.key`

**Owner Certificate** (`/etc/pki/go-fdo-server/{owner.crt,owner.key}`)
- Certificate (`owner.crt`): Generated on Owner server, then copied to Manufacturing server
- Private key (`owner.key`): Used only by Owner server for TO2 protocol
- Manufacturer needs owner certificate to extend vouchers to the correct owner
- Must be created manually or using the helper script
- Default filenames in configs: `owner-example.crt`/`owner-example.key`

### Shared Certificates

**Device CA Certificate** (`/etc/pki/go-fdo-server/{device-ca.crt,device-ca.key}`)
- Signs device certificates during DI protocol (Manufacturer server)
- When configured on the Owner server, only vouchers signed by a trusted Device CA are accepted during import
- When not configured on the Owner server, vouchers signed by any Device CA are accepted during import
- Must be created once and distributed to both servers if Device CA verification is desired

The Device CA verification behavior varies by server role:

| Server | Device CA required? | Behavior when configured | Behavior when not configured |
|--------|--------------------|--------------------------|-----------------------------|
| Manufacturing | Yes (for DI) | Signs device certificates; verifies device cert chain on voucher import | N/A — required for device initialization |
| Owner | No | Only vouchers signed by a trusted Device CA are accepted during import | Vouchers from any Device CA are accepted during import |
| Rendezvous | No | Only vouchers with a trusted Device CA cert chain are accepted during TO0 | Chain integrity is verified but any root CA is accepted during TO0 |

**Note**: Configuring Device CA certificates on the Owner and Rendezvous servers is recommended for production deployments to restrict which devices can onboard. Omitting them allows open import/registration, which may be useful in development or multi-manufacturer environments.

### HTTPS/TLS Certificates

Do not confuse the FDO certificates with TLS certificates used for HTTPS server authentication. The FDO certificates are separate from the TLS certificates:

- **FDO protocol**: Uses manufacturer/owner/device-ca certificates and keys (this guide)
- **HTTPS server**: Configured via `--http-cert` and `--http-key` flags or reverse proxy

For production, use proper TLS certificates from a trusted CA (Let's Encrypt, internal CA, etc.) for the HTTPS server.

## Quick Start: Single-Host Testing

For development or testing with all FDO services on one host, a helper script is included in the FDO server packages. This script will generate all the certificates and keys necessary to run the FDO servers in a test environment.

**IMPORTANT**: These are self-signed test certificates and are suitable for testing and demonstration purposes *only*. Never use them in production.

To generate these example certificates and keys, use the provided helper script:

```bash
sudo /usr/libexec/go-fdo-server/generate-go-fdo-server-certs.sh
```

This script generates ALL certificates (manufacturer, owner, and device-ca) in `/etc/pki/go-fdo-server/` and sets appropriate permissions.

**Generated files:**
- `device-ca-example.crt` / `device-ca-example.key` (shared certificate)
- `manufacturer-example.crt` / `manufacturer-example.key` (manufacturer local)
- `owner-example.crt` / `owner-example.key` (owner local)

After running the script, you can start the services:

```bash
sudo systemctl start go-fdo-server-manufacturer.service
sudo systemctl start go-fdo-server-rendezvous.service
sudo systemctl start go-fdo-server-owner.service
```

## Production Deployment (Multi-Host)

For production deployments with manufacturer, rendezvous, and owner on separate hosts:

### Step 1: Generate Device CA (Once, Secure Host)

Generate the shared device CA on a secure administration host:

```bash
# Generate device CA private key (DER format)
openssl ecparam -name prime256v1 -genkey -out device-ca.key -outform der

# Generate self-signed device CA certificate (valid 10 years)
openssl req -x509 -key device-ca.key -keyform der -out device-ca.crt \
  -days 3650 -subj "/C=US/O=YourOrg/CN=FDO Device CA"

# Secure the private key
chmod 600 device-ca.key
```

**IMPORTANT**: Keep the `device-ca.key` secure. This is the trust anchor for all devices.

### Step 2: Distribute Device CA

Securely copy device CA files to both servers:

**To Manufacturer Server:**
```bash
# Copy both certificate and key to manufacturer
scp device-ca.crt device-ca.key manufacturer-host:/tmp/

# Set ownership and move to correct location (on manufacturer host)
ssh manufacturer-host
sudo mv /tmp/device-ca.crt /tmp/device-ca.key /etc/pki/go-fdo-server/
sudo chown go-fdo-server-manufacturer:go-fdo-server /etc/pki/go-fdo-server/device-ca.*
sudo chmod 644 /etc/pki/go-fdo-server/device-ca.crt
sudo chmod 640 /etc/pki/go-fdo-server/device-ca.key
```

**To Owner Server:**
```bash
# Copy only certificate to owner (key not needed)
scp device-ca.crt owner-host:/tmp/

# Set ownership and move to correct location (on owner host)
ssh owner-host
sudo mv /tmp/device-ca.crt /etc/pki/go-fdo-server/
sudo chown go-fdo-server-owner:go-fdo-server /etc/pki/go-fdo-server/device-ca.crt
sudo chmod 644 /etc/pki/go-fdo-server/device-ca.crt
```

**Note**: The Owner server only needs `device-ca.crt` for verification, not the private key.

### Step 3: Generate Local Certificates

**On Manufacturer Server:**
```bash
# Generate manufacturer private key (DER format)
openssl ecparam -name prime256v1 -genkey -out /etc/pki/go-fdo-server/manufacturer.key -outform der

# Generate manufacturer certificate
openssl req -x509 -key /etc/pki/go-fdo-server/manufacturer.key -keyform der \
  -out /etc/pki/go-fdo-server/manufacturer.crt \
  -days 3650 -subj "/C=US/O=YourOrg/CN=FDO Manufacturer"

# Set permissions
sudo chown go-fdo-server-manufacturer:go-fdo-server /etc/pki/go-fdo-server/manufacturer.*
sudo chmod 644 /etc/pki/go-fdo-server/manufacturer.crt
sudo chmod 640 /etc/pki/go-fdo-server/manufacturer.key
```

**On Owner Server:**
```bash
# Generate owner private key (DER format)
openssl ecparam -name prime256v1 -genkey -out /etc/pki/go-fdo-server/owner.key -outform der

# Generate owner certificate
openssl req -x509 -key /etc/pki/go-fdo-server/owner.key -keyform der \
  -out /etc/pki/go-fdo-server/owner.crt \
  -days 3650 -subj "/C=US/O=YourOrg/CN=FDO Owner"

# Set permissions
sudo chown go-fdo-server-owner:go-fdo-server /etc/pki/go-fdo-server/owner.*
sudo chmod 644 /etc/pki/go-fdo-server/owner.crt
sudo chmod 640 /etc/pki/go-fdo-server/owner.key
```

### Step 4: Exchange Owner Certificate

The Manufacturing server needs a copy of the owner's public certificate to extend ownership vouchers during device initialization.

**From Owner Server, copy certificate to manufacturer:**
```bash
scp /etc/pki/go-fdo-server/owner.crt manufacturer-host:/tmp/
```

**On Manufacturer Server:**
```bash
# Move to correct location
sudo mv /tmp/owner.crt /etc/pki/go-fdo-server/

# Set ownership and permissions
sudo chown go-fdo-server-manufacturer:go-fdo-server /etc/pki/go-fdo-server/owner.crt
sudo chmod 644 /etc/pki/go-fdo-server/owner.crt
```

### Step 5: Update Configuration Files

Edit `/etc/go-fdo-server/manufacturing.yaml` and `/etc/go-fdo-server/owner.yaml` to update certificate paths from the default `-example` suffix to the plain filenames created above (e.g., change `manufacturer-example.key` to `manufacturer.key`).

### Step 6: Start Services

```bash
# Manufacturer host
sudo systemctl enable --now go-fdo-server-manufacturer.service

# Rendezvous host (no FDO protocol certificates needed)
sudo systemctl enable --now go-fdo-server-rendezvous.service

# Owner host
sudo systemctl enable --now go-fdo-server-owner.service
```
