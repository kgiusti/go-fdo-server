# Configuration File Reference

This document describes all configuration options available for the FDO server. Configuration files can use TOML or YAML format.

Command-line arguments take precedence over configuration file values. The server address can be specified either as a command-line argument or in the configuration file under the appropriate section.

## Configuration File Location

The configuration file can be specified via the `--config` server command line parameter, for example:

```bash
# Using TOML configuration file:
go-fdo-server manufacturing --config /etc/config.toml

# Using YAML configuration file in the local directory with listening address override:
go-fdo-server owner --config config.yaml 127.0.0.1:8080

# Using TOML, enable debug logging
go-fdo-server rendezvous --log-level=debug --config /home/fdo/config.toml
```

If `--config` is not provided the server will search the following directories in order until a configuration file is found:

- `$HOME/.config/go-fdo-server/`
- `/etc/go-fdo-server/`
- `/usr/share/go-fdo-server/`

The name of the configuration file is based on the server's role, with the file name suffix corresponding to the file format:

| Role | Filename | Examples |
|------|----------|----------|
| Manufacturer | `manufacturing.<suffix>` | `manufacturing.yaml`, `manufacturing.toml` |
| Owner | `owner.<suffix>` | `owner.yaml`, `owner.toml` |
| Rendezvous | `rendezvous.<suffix>` | `rendezvous.yaml`, `rendezvous.toml` |

## Configuration Structure

The configuration file uses a hierarchical structure that defines the following sections:

- `log` - Logging level configuration
- `db` - Database configuration
- `http` - HTTP server configuration
- `device_ca` - Device Certificate Authority configuration
- `manufacturing` - Manufacturing server-specific configuration
- `owner` - Owner server-specific configuration
- `rendezvous` - Rendezvous server-specific configuration

## Logging Configuration

| Key | Type | Description | Default |
|-----|------|-------------|---------|
| `level` | string | Set the logging level. Allowed values: "debug", "info", "warn", or "error" | info |

## Database Configuration

A database is used to persist server state and is required for all
server roles. The database configuration is provided under the `[db]`
section:

| Key | Type | Description | Required |
|-----|------|-------------|----------|
| `type` | string | Database type (e.g., "sqlite", "postgres") | Yes |
| `dsn` | string | Database connection string (e.g., `file:database.db` for SQLite, `host=localhost port=5432 user=postgres password=secret dbname=mydb` for PostgreSQL) | Yes |

## HTTP Server Configuration

All servers provide an HTTP endpoint. The HTTP server configuration is
provided under the `[http]` section:

| Key | Type | Description | Required |
|-----|------|-------------|----------|
| `ip` | string | HTTP server IP address or hostname | Yes |
| `port` | string | HTTP server port | Yes |
| `cert` | string | Path to server certificate file | No |
| `key` | string | Path to server private key file | No |

**Note**: HTTPS (TLS) is automatically enabled when both `cert` and `key` are provided.

## Device Certificate Authority (CA) Configuration

The Device CA configuration is under the `[device_ca]` section. This section is required for the Manufacturing server and optional for the Owner and Rendezvous servers:

| Key | Type | Description | Required |
|-----|------|-------------|----------|
| `cert` | string | Device CA certificate file path | Yes (Manufacturing), No (Owner, Rendezvous) |
| `key` | string | Device CA private key file path | Yes (Manufacturing only) |

When configured on the Owner server, only vouchers signed by the specified Device CA are accepted during import. When omitted, vouchers from any Device CA are accepted.

When configured on the Rendezvous server, the device certificate chain is verified against the specified Device CA during the TO0 protocol. When omitted, chain integrity is verified (the chain is internally consistent) but any root CA is accepted, allowing any device to register.

## Manufacturing Server Configuration

The Manufacturing server configuration is under the `[manufacturing]` section:

| Key | Type | Description | Required |
|-----|------|-------------|----------|
| `key` | string | Manufacturing private key file path | Yes |

The Manufacturing server also requires:

- `[device_ca]` section with both `cert` and `key` (see Device CA Configuration above)
- `[owner]` section with `cert` field (see Owner Configuration below)

## Owner Server Configuration

The Owner server configuration is under the `[owner]` section:

| Key | Type | Description | Required |
|-----|------|-------------|----------|
| `cert` | string | Owner certificate file path | Yes (for Manufacturing server) |
| `key` | string | Owner private key file path | Yes (for Owner server) |
| `reuse_credentials` | boolean | Perform the Credential Reuse Protocol in TO2 | No (default: `false`) |
| `to0_insecure_tls` | boolean | Skip TLS certificate verification for TO0 | No (default: `false`) |
| `service_info` | map | ServiceInfo Modules to execute on device onboarding (See below) | No |

The Owner server optionally accepts:

- `[device_ca]` section with `cert` field to restrict voucher imports to a trusted Device CA (see Device CA Configuration above). When omitted, vouchers from any Device CA are accepted.

**Note**: The `owner.cert` field is used by the Manufacturing server to specify the Owner certificate. The `owner.key` field is used by the Owner server to specify its private key.

### Service Info Configuration (FSIM Operations)

The Owner server can be configured to execute FSIM (FDO Service Info Module) operations during device onboarding. See the [FSIM Guide](fsim-guide.md) for a description of each supported FSIM module. FSIM operations are defined as an ordered list `fsims` under the `service_info` field within the `[owner]` section. Each list entry contains the name of the FSIM operation to perform and parameters to pass to the operation. FSIM operations may be listed in any order but will be executed on the device in the order they appear in the list.

### Supported FSIM Modules

The following FSIM modules are supported:

1. `fdo.command` - Execute commands on the device
2. `fdo.download` - Download files from the Owner server to the device
3. `fdo.upload` - Upload files from the device to the Owner server
4. `fdo.wget` - Instruct the device to download files from specified URLs

### Service Info Operation Structure

Each operation in the `service_info.fsims` list has the following structure:

| Field | Type | Description | Required |
|-------|------|-------------|----------|
| `fsim` | string | The FSIM module type (one of: `fdo.command`, `fdo.download`, `fdo.upload`, `fdo.wget`) | Yes |
| `params` | object | Parameters for the FSIM module (structure depends on the fsim type) | Yes |

### Service Info Defaults

The `service_info` configuration supports an optional `defaults` section that allows you to specify default directory values for FSIM operations. This reduces repetition when multiple operations use the same directories.

The `defaults` field is a list of default entries with the following structure:

| Field | Type | Description | Required |
|-------|------|-------------|----------|
| `fsim` | string | The FSIM module type (one of: `fdo.download`, `fdo.upload`, `fdo.wget`) | Yes |
| `dir` | string | Default directory path (must be absolute) | Yes |

**IMPORTANT**:

- Each `fsim` value can appear only once in the defaults list (maximum of 3 entries)
- The `dir` path must be absolute
- For `fdo.download` and `fdo.upload`, the directory must exist on the Owner server at startup
- For `fdo.wget`, the directory is on the device (existence is not checked at startup)
- Defaults can be overridden by specifying `params.dir` in individual FSIM operations
- If neither a default nor `params.dir` is specified, the current working directory is used

#### Defaults Example

```yaml
service_info:
  defaults:
    - fsim: "fdo.download"
      dir: "/var/lib/go-fdo-server-owner/downloads"
    - fsim: "fdo.upload"
      dir: "/var/lib/go-fdo-server-owner/uploads"
    - fsim: "fdo.wget"
      dir: "/var/lib/device/wget/files"
  fsims:
    - fsim: "fdo.download"
      params:
        # dir not specified - uses default from above
        files:
          - src: "app.tar.gz"
            dst: "/tmp/app.tar.gz"
    - fsim: "fdo.upload"
      params:
        dir: "/custom/upload/path"  # Override default
        files:
          - src: "/var/log/syslog"
            dst: "device-syslog.log"
```

### `fdo.command` Parameters

Execute commands on the device.

| Field | Type | Description | Required |
|-------|------|-------------|----------|
| `cmd` | string | The command to execute (e.g., `chmod`, `mkdir`, `bash`, etc.). If `cmd` is set to a pathname of an executable file, the `go-fdo-client` runs it directly. Otherwise, the `go-fdo-client` will search for `cmd` in the directories given in its `PATH` environment variable. | Yes |
| `args` | array of strings | Command arguments | No |
| `may_fail` | boolean | If true, allow the command to fail without aborting onboarding | No (default: `false`) |
| `return_stdout` | boolean | If true, the device's stdout stream from the command will be sent to the Owner server and written to the logs | No (default: `false`) |
| `return_stderr` | boolean | If true, the device's stderr stream from the command will be sent to the Owner server and written to the logs | No (default: `false`) |

### `fdo.command` Example

```yaml
fsim: "fdo.command"
params:
  may_fail: false
  return_stdout: true
  cmd: "bash"
  args:
    - "-c"
    - |
      #! /bin/bash
      set -xeuo pipefail
      echo "Current Date:"
      date
      dmidecode --quiet --dump-bin /var/lib/fdo/upload/dmidecode
```

### `fdo.download` Parameters

Download files from the Owner server to the device.

| Field | Type | Description | Required |
|-------|------|-------------|----------|
| `dir` | string | Base directory path on the Owner server where source files are located (used when `files.src` is relative). If not specified, uses the default from `service_info.defaults` or the Owner server's current working directory. | No |
| `files` | array of objects | List of files to download | Yes |

Each file object in the `files` array has:

| Field | Type | Description | Required |
|-------|------|-------------|----------|
| `src` | string | Path to the file on the Owner server. Can be absolute (ignores `params.dir`) or relative (appended to `params.dir`). | Yes |
| `dst` | string | Destination path on the device. Can be absolute or relative (to device working directory). | Yes |
| `may_fail` | boolean | If true, allow the download to fail without aborting onboarding | No (default: `false`) |

### `fdo.download` Example

```yaml
fsim: "fdo.download"
params:
  dir: "/var/lib/fdo/downloads"
  files:
    - src: "configs/app-config.json"  # relative to dir, file at /var/lib/fdo/downloads/configs/app-config.json
      dst: "/etc/myapp/config.json"  # absolute path on device
    - src: "/opt/scripts/setup.sh"  # absolute path, ignores dir
      dst: "setup.sh"  # relative to device working directory
      may_fail: true  # this file download is optional
```

### `fdo.upload` Parameters

Upload files from the device to the Owner server. Files are uploaded to a per-device directory on the Owner server. The name of the directory is the device's replacement GUID (the GUID that is set after onboarding completes). This prevents files with the same name from being overwritten as devices are onboarded.

| Field | Type | Description | Required |
|-------|------|-------------|----------|
| `dir` | string | Absolute path to a directory on the Owner server where uploaded files will be stored. A per-device subdirectory is created in this directory for each device that uploads files during onboarding. If not set, the directory from the `fdo.upload` entry in `service_info.defaults` is used. | No |
| `files` | array of objects | List of files to request from the device | Yes |

Each file object in the `files` array has:

| Field | Type | Description | Required |
|-------|------|-------------|----------|
| `src` | string | Path to the file on the device to upload. Can be absolute or relative (to device working directory). | Yes |
| `dst` | string | Destination filename (optionally with parent sub-directories) in the per-device directory on the Owner server. If omitted, the basename of `src` will be used. Must be a relative path. | No |

### `fdo.upload` Example

```yaml
fsim: "fdo.upload"
params:
  dir: "/var/lib/fdo/uploads"
  files:
    - src: "/etc/hostname"
      dst: "device-hostname.txt"  # saved to /var/lib/fdo/uploads/$GUID/device-hostname.txt
    - src: "/var/log/device.log"
      dst: "logs/device-12345.log"  # saved to /var/lib/fdo/uploads/$GUID/logs/device-12345.log
    - src: "/sys/class/dmi/id/product_uuid"
      dst: "system-info/uuid"  # saved to /var/lib/fdo/uploads/$GUID/system-info/uuid
    - src: "/etc/machine-id"
      # dst omitted - saved to /var/lib/fdo/uploads/$GUID/machine-id
```

### `fdo.wget` Parameters

Instruct the device to download content from an HTTP server.

| Field | Type | Description | Required |
|-------|------|-------------|----------|
| `dir` | string | Absolute path to a directory on the device where files will be downloaded. If not specified, uses the default from `service_info.defaults` or the device's current working directory. Used as base directory for relative `files.dst` paths. | No |
| `files` | array of objects | List of URLs that the device will retrieve content from and the file paths where the content will be stored. | Yes |

Each file object in the `files` array has:

| Field | Type | Description | Required |
|-------|------|-------------|----------|
| `url` | string | URL to download from (scheme must be `http` or `https`) | Yes |
| `dst` | string | Destination filename on the device for the retrieved content. If omitted the basename of the URL path is used. Can be an absolute path or relative (joined with `dir` if specified).  | No |
| `length` | integer | For validation: expected size of downloaded content in bytes | No |
| `checksum` | string | For validation: Expected SHA-384 checksum of the file (96 hexadecimal characters) | No |

### `fdo.wget` Example

```yaml
fsim: "fdo.wget"
params:
  dir: "/root/downloads"
  files:
    - url: "https://example.com/packages/app-v1.2.3.rpm"
      dst: "/tmp/app.rpm"
      length: 2048576
      checksum: "a1b2c3d4e5f..."
    - url: "https://cdn.example.com/updates/firmware.bin"
    - url: "https://cdn.example.com/updates/license.txt"
      dst: "license.txt"
```

For the example above the first download will be saved to `/tmp/app.rpm`, the second to `/root/downloads/firmware.bin` and the last to `/root/downloads/license.txt`.

## Rendezvous Server Configuration

The Rendezvous server configuration is under the `[rendezvous]` section:

| Key | Type | Description | Default |
|-----|------|-------------|---------|
| `to0_min_wait` | integer | Minimum wait time the Rendezvous server will accept for an entry registered by the Owner server during TO0 protocol. If the Owner server requests a shorter wait time, it is rejected. | 0 (no minimum) |
| `to0_max_wait` | integer | Maximum wait time the Rendezvous server will keep an entry registered by the Owner server during TO0 protocol before it expires. If the Owner server requests a longer wait time, it is capped to this value. | 86400 (24 hours) |
| `cleanup_interval` | integer | Interval in seconds for automatic cleanup of expired rendezvous blobs and sessions. The cleanup task runs periodically in the background, removing rendezvous blobs that have exceeded their expiration time and sessions older than `session_timeout` to prevent database bloat. Set to 0 to disable automatic cleanup (not recommended for production). | 3600 (1 hour) |
| `session_timeout` | integer | Maximum age in seconds for protocol sessions (TO0/TO1) before cleanup. Sessions older than this age will be deleted during periodic cleanup, along with their associated session data. This prevents accumulation of orphaned sessions from interrupted or failed protocol exchanges. | 3600 (1 hour) |
| `initial_cleanup_delay` | integer | Delay in seconds before the first cleanup runs after server startup. This prevents startup spikes when restarting servers with large amounts of expired data, allowing the server to start serving requests before running potentially heavy cleanup operations. | 300 (5 minutes) |

**Note**: The Rendezvous server performs periodic background cleanup to prevent database bloat. Expired rendezvous blobs and old sessions are automatically removed based on the configured intervals.

### Device CA Trust on the Rendezvous Server

The Rendezvous server verifies the device certificate chain of ownership vouchers during the TO0 protocol. Trusted Device CA certificates can be uploaded via the management API (Device CA endpoints).

- When one or more Device CA certificates are uploaded, only vouchers whose device certificate chain is signed by a trusted Device CA are accepted during TO0.
- When no Device CA certificates are uploaded, the Rendezvous server performs chain integrity validation only (verifies the chain is internally consistent) but accepts any root CA. This allows any device to register.

## Notes

- All file paths in the configuration should be absolute paths or paths relative to the current working directory
- Boolean values can be specified as `true`/`false` in TOML or `true`/`false` in YAML
- The configuration file uses a hierarchical structure where each server type has its own section
- Command-line arguments take precedence over configuration file values
- The HTTP server listen address can be overridden by providing it as a positional argument to the command (e.g., `go-fdo-server owner 127.0.0.1:8080`)
- Both `http.cert` and `http.key` MUST be provided in order to enable HTTP over TLS (HTTPS).
