# FDO Server RPM Installation Guide
This document covers installing and verifying FDO Server RPM packages.
The FDO Server RPM packaging creates 4 packages:
- `go-fdo-server` - Main package with binary and shared components
- `go-fdo-server-manufacturer` - Manufacturer server systemd service
- `go-fdo-server-rendezvous` - Rendezvous server systemd service
- `go-fdo-server-owner` - Owner server systemd service

All these packages will be installed from Fedora Official repos or COPR. 

## 1.Installation

```bash
#If installing from COPR first enable COPR repository.
sudo dnf copr enable @fedora-iot/fedora-iot

# Install packages
sudo dnf install go-fdo-server go-fdo-server-manufacturer go-fdo-server-rendezvous go-fdo-server-owner
```

## 2.Configuration

Each service can be configured via a configuration file located in the /etc/go-fdo-server directory.
- `/etc/go-fdo-server/manufacturing.yaml`
- `/etc/go-fdo-server/rendezvous.yaml`
- `/etc/go-fdo-server/owner.yaml`

If the **certificates** do not exist then a set of self-signed test
certificates are automatically generated when the service
starts. These generated certificates are provided for testing purposes
only and should **not** be used in production.
Default location for the certificates is /etc/pki/go-fdo-server/.

**Database files** are generated by default at below locations:
- `Manufacturer: /var/lib/go-fdo-server-manufacturer/db.sqlite`
- `Rendezvous: /var/lib/go-fdo-server-rendezvous/db.sqlite`
- `Owner: /var/lib/go-fdo-server-owner/db.sqlite`

## 3.Service Management

```bash
# Start services
sudo systemctl start go-fdo-server-manufacturer.service
sudo systemctl start go-fdo-server-rendezvous.service
sudo systemctl start go-fdo-server-owner.service

# Enable services
sudo systemctl enable go-fdo-server-*.service

# Stop services
sudo systemctl stop go-fdo-server-*.service
```

## 4.Uninstall RPMs

```bash
sudo systemctl stop go-fdo-server-*.service
sudo dnf remove go-fdo-server-*
