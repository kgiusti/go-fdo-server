# Modifying this file in-place is not recommended, because changes
# will be overwritten during package upgrades.  To customize the
# behaviour, run "systemctl edit go-fdo-server-manufacturer" to create
# an override unit.
#
# For example, to pass additional command line options to the server
# at startup create an override unit (as is done by systemctl edit)
# and enter the following:
#

#	Environment=OPTIONS="--log-level debug"
