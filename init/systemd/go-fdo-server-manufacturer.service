# Modifying this file in-place is not recommended because changes will
# be overwritten during package upgrades. Customization should be done
# by using a systemd "drop-in" instead.
#
# For example to add an additional command line option to enable debug
# logging create an override "drop-in" unit (as is done by systemctl
# edit) and enter the following:
#
#	[Service]
#       ExecStart=
#       ExecStart=/bin/sh -c 'exec /usr/bin/go-fdo-server manufacturing --log-level debug'
